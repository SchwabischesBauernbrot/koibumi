## Recent improvement

- The default bot avatar is now 50x50px (used to be 400x600) to load faster

## General information

Work in progress.

Instructions to install to come, but you can just look up how to import an unpacked extension on your browser.

Should work but is not thoroughly tested.

Open the extension options to put in your API key and other settings.

Will be added to the Chrome store later.

## Known issues

You may need to refresh a page or restart your browser after enabling the extension in order for it to work on your current page.
