# Koibumi

Work in progress.

Instructions to install to come, but you can just look up how to import an
unpacked extension on your browser.

Should work but is not thoroughly tested.

Open the extension options to put in your API key and other settings.

Will be added to the Chrome store later.

# Known issues

You need to refresh a page or restart your browser after enabling the extension
in order for it to work on your current page.

I'm not yet sure if a letter will show up when it's due if your focused window
is not the browser.
